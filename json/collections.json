            "description": "Boarding, overnights & pet visits.  Sue focuses her business on in-home care, either at Sue’s large home or the home of the client. Sue has owned, loved and treasured both dogs and cats for most of her life.  Her business started a little over 20 years ago when she saw an unmet need for quality in home pet care, especially for people wanting to travel often but not wanting to leave their beloved pets in a kennel.  Whether your dog comes to stay at Sue’s house or Sue stays at yours, you can relax knowing your pet is getting lots of attention and super care while you are away.  As the name implies, we want to be as good as Just Like Home. . .or better.  We are also happy to email daily or weekly reports and pictures of your pet while you are away.  References are available and offered at time of an interview.  I invite you to call for more information.",
