<p>If you are a professional pet sitter in the Indianapolis or surrounding area, we invite you to join the <strong>Indy Area Pet Sitters Network</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IAPSN</strong> is a professional network consisting of individually owned pet care companies that serve the Indianapolis and surrounding area pets and their people. We joined together (informally) in 2009 to create new friendships, to network, to educate and support one another, and to have fun!</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>Members communicate through a private Yahoo Group Forum (email messages). You will be invited to join The Forum after your membership is accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Meetings</strong></p>
<p>We meet most months on the 2nd Tuesday of the month from 4:00-5:30 at the Nora Library (8625 Guilford Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46240) in a private meeting room. See schedule on <a href="http://www.iapsn.com/members"><em>Members</em></a> page. We are open to having meetings in other locations when a member volunteers to set it up. We encourage you to attend as many meetings as you can so we can get to know you better.</p>
<p><strong>Referrals</strong></p>
<p>It is common for us to refer potential clients to each other, and the better we know you the more referrals you are likely to receive. We also try to provide back up for each other when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>In addition to providing advice to each other, we occasionally have guest speakers at our monthly meetings. Some past speakers have been: Dog trainers, Veterinarians, Tax Consultants, Animal Rescue Groups, a Pet Nutritionist, a Pet Communicator, a Bird Specialist, and a Pet Memorial Center representative. We have also hosted group Pet First Aid Courses. Some of our members participated in a book study group to discuss canine behavior management<em>.</em> We encourage our members to submit topic ideas on the forum and to suggest any potential guest speakers they might have access to. The more effort each member is willing to put into this, the more interesting our meetings will be.</p>

<p><strong>Community Outreach &amp; Support</strong></p>
<p>We have collected donations for Animal Care &amp; Control and Indy Claw Rescue. We have donated our time at dog washes for Prison Greyhounds and at F.A.C.E. We have manned booths at various charity functions. All activities are volunteer based and require the willingness of our members to organize and participate in them. If we have motivated members willing to put in the effort, we will continue these types of activities. However, we will NOT pressure our members to do these types of things as we understand that we are all very busy individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>
<p>Every year so far, <strong>IAPSN</strong> has celebrated with an annual Christmas/Holiday gathering in a memberâ€™s home. We have enjoyed this fun event! We occasionally share funny stories on the Yahoo Forum as well.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>
<p>We originally had a structured Leadership Team that did the majority of the work. Now we have two teams which allow us to share the responsibilities more evenly. Teams alternate monthly to plan a meeting or event. Participation on one of these teams is mandatory. When you fill out your application, you will select your team choice.</p>
<p><strong>How to Join</strong></p>
<p>Potential members may attend one meeting as a guest. Please RSVP at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#x40;&#105;&#x61;&#x70;&#x73;&#110;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#x40;&#105;&#x61;&#x70;&#x73;&#110;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> before your first meeting so that we can advise you of any changes to our schedule. Please print the <a href="http://www.iapsn.com/user_assets/member-application-new.doc"><em>Membership Application (MS Word)</em></a> or <a href="http://www.iapsn.com/user_assets/member-application-new.pdf"><em>Membership Application (PDF)</em></a> from this website and bring your completed application to the meeting and turn it in if you decide you would like to join our group. We will not accept your application until you attend a meeting. Annual dues currently are $24 per year (pro-rated if you join after January).</p>
<p>Members must carry business liability insurance at all times, and you must provide a copy of your insurance with your application. Every member must attend at least one meeting per year. We encourage you to attend as many as you can so we can get to know you better and feel comfortable referring potential clients to you.</p>
